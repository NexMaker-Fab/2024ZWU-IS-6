          <h2>How to keep safe when laser cutting?
            <p>
                    <h4> 1. Laser beams can cause serious damage to both eyes and skin, so be sure to wear appropriate protective glasses while working.
                        <img src="https://github.com/xiixiiiii/xiix/blob/main/f11b928b434b1251755eeedceaa5675.jpg?raw=true"class="paper-image" alt="pic">
                        <h4>     2. When the laser cutting machine is working, do not put your hands or other objects into the cutting area. 
                         <h4>    3.Only person who have received appropriate training and qualifications can operate laser cutting machines. 
                         <h4>    4. Before each use, check whether all safety devices of the equipment are intact and undamaged.
                         <h4>   5. During the cutting process, harmful smoke and gases may be generated, so it is necessary to ensure a good ventilation system. 
                         <h4>   6. Ensure that there are no flammable materials around the work area to prevent cutting sparks from causing fires.
                         <h4>    7. After the cutting is completed, the laser cutting machine should be turned off and the working area cleaned. 
                         <h4>   8. In emergency situations, immediately stop the operation and know how to use fire extinguishers and first aid equipment.
                            <h2>Laser cutting machine cutting stainless steel plate</h2>
                            <h4>Fiber laser cutting machine</h4>
                            <h5>
                              Fiber laser cutting machine is an option for stainless steel cutting, and has several advantages over traditional cutting methods such as carbon dioxide laser cutting machine, plasma cutting and water jet cutting. Fiber laser machines use a solid laser source, which produces a laser beam through the amplification of the laser in the fiber. Fiber laser cutting machine has high efficiency, excellent beam quality, and can achieve precise high-speed cutting of stainless steel.</h5>

                              <p></p>
                              <h4>Prepare materials</h4>
                            <h5>
                              Accurate measurement and marking of stainless steel plates is essential to achieve accurate cutting. Before laser cutting, the stainless steel surface must be properly cleaned to ensure the best results. Applying a splash-proof coating helps prevent molten metal from adhering to the surface during the cutting process. In order to minimize vibration during the cutting process, it is important to secure the material firmly in place using jigs or fixtures.</h5>

                              <p></p>
                              <h4>Set up the laser cutter</h4> 
                              
                            <h5>When setting the stainless steel laser cutting machine, it is necessary to adjust according to the thickness of the plate. For thin parts, such as metal plates or valve plates, the laser power and speed Settings may need to be adjusted to achieve the desired results. On the other hand, thick plates or alloy materials may require higher power levels and slower cutting speeds.</h5>
                            <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/0afea2b7ba801985ef50332847aa3a6.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
                            <p></p><h4>Cutting process</h4>
                            <h5>
                              During laser cutting, computer-controlled machines follow programming instructions to accurately create complex shapes and designs. Auxiliary gases such as nitrogen or oxygen are usually used to blow away molten metal and debris from the cut area. The speed at which the laser passes through the material affects the cutting quality and processing time.
                            </h5>
                            <p></p><h4>Execution cutting</h4>
                              <h5>The cutting process begins by entering the design file into the laser cutting machine's software. The machine then uses a laser beam to precisely cut the surface of the stainless steel material according to the design specifications. The laser beam is sharply focused at a focal point, and as the laser beam moves along the cutting path, the stainless steel is melted and evaporated.</h5>
                              <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/e31191b1-0700-4f73-b651-d3f85dc89019.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
                              <p></p><h4>Monitor and adjust parameters</h4>
                            <h5>
                              In order to ensure the best cutting results, it is important to monitor and adjust various parameters throughout the process. These parameters include:
                              
                              Laser power: The power of the laser beam determines its ability to melt or evaporate stainless steel. Adjusting this parameter can precisely control the cutting depth.
                              <p></p>
                              Cutting speed: The speed at which the laser passes through the material affects the cutting quality and processing time. Finding the right balance is crucial to achieving a clean cut without compromising efficiency.
                              <p></p>
                              Auxiliary gas pressure: In the laser cutting and engraving process, oxygen or inert gases (such as nitrogen) are often used as auxiliary gases. Controlled cutting gas pressure helps to blow away molten metal and debris, ensuring a cleaner cutting and engraving process.
                              <p></p>
                              Focus position: Correctly adjusting the focus position of the laser beam ensures accurate engraving and cutting results. Correct adjustment of this parameter can achieve a narrow incision width.
                              <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/5174665bb3a9cbcbb3aedc6331cbc79.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
                              <p></p>
                              Material thickness: Different thicknesses of stainless steel need to adjust the cutting parameters to obtain the best results. Thicker materials may require slower speeds and higher power Settings, while thinner materials may require faster speeds and lower power Settings. By carefully monitoring and adjusting these parameters, laser cutters can make precise cuts to stainless steel with minimal distortion or marks.</h5>

                    <h2>How to keep safe when using CNC?
                       
                        <h4>    1. When working, it is necessary to wear appropriate safety protective equipment, including safety goggles, ear protectors, protective shoes, and appropriate work clothes. 
                            <h4>   2. Before starting up, check the work area, remove all objects that may interfere with operation or cause accidents, and ensure that the machine is completely exposed and free from foreign objects.
                                <h4>   3. Before starting the cutting work, double check all settings and tool paths.
                                    <h4>   4. Before starting the equipment, the protective door of the machine tool must be closed. Do not open the protective door at will when the machine tool is in operation.
                                       
                                        <h4>   5. Sundries and cutting waste may cause hazards such as slipping or falling. After each work is completed, the machine and work area should be cleaned.
