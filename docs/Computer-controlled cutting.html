                                <h4>   5. Due to the invisible nature of this type of laser, it is strictly prohibited to place flammable and explosive materials near the equipment to prevent laser misalignment and fire
                    Disaster.
                    <h4>   6. It is strictly prohibited to place any unrelated total reflection or diffuse reflection objects in the equipment to prevent direct laser reflection on the human body or
                    On flammable materials.
                    <h4>  7. During the operation of the machine, the operator must always observe the working condition of the machine (such as deformed edges, and the paper being laid)
                    Whether the laser is blocked by the air pump blowing high, the machine makes abnormal noises, the temperature of the circulating water, etc.
                    <h4>  8. Do not push or pull the trolley or crossbeam by hand.

                            <h4>  10. Do not turn on the machine when the voltage is unstable, otherwise a voltage regulator must be used.
                                <h4> 11. Untrained personnel are prohibited from using.
                                    <h4>  12. The continuous working time of laser cutting processing shall not exceed 5 hours (with a break of at least half an hour during the process).
                                        <h4>  13. The water circulation must be kept clean, and the water temperature should not exceed 20-30 degrees (pure water is recommended).
                                            <h4>   14. It is strictly prohibited to turn on the ammeter at its maximum value to avoid breakdown of the laser power supply and shorten the lifespan of the laser tube.
                                                <h4>  15. The basic limitations of using laser power supply (i.e. the maximum current meter cannot exceed 20mA)

                                                <p>
                                                    <h4>Metallic material</h4>
                                                    <h5>
                                                      Carbon Steel : is one of the most common metalworking materials, widely used in construction, automotive, machinery manufacturing and other industries due to its strength and cost effectiveness. When laser cutting carbon steel, the appropriate auxiliary gas (oxygen or nitrogen) is selected according to the thickness, which can effectively control the cutting speed and edge oxidation.
                                                      <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cashewwwww/00/img/737c15b0af266d593113c1ecea0255b.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">

                                                      Stainless Steel: Because of its corrosion resistance, it is widely used in kitchen equipment, medical equipment, decoration and other fields. When stainless steel is laser cut, the edge is almost free of oxidation, which is especially suitable for using nitrogen as an auxiliary gas to maintain the gloss and rust resistance of the material.
                                                      <p></p>
                                                      Aluminum alloy (Aluminum) : light weight and high strength, commonly found in aerospace, automotive, electronic products. When cutting aluminum alloys, due to its high reflectivity and thermal conductivity, it usually requires higher laser power and specialized cutting parameters, sometimes coupled with oxygen or nitrogen.
                                                      <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cashewwwww/00/img/2d7c0e3c44e6f596a9bc7cd531a24c9.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">

                                                      Copper and copper alloys (Copper & Brass) : Pure copper because of its high reflectivity and thermal conductivity, laser cutting is more difficult, but brass (a copper alloy) is relatively easy to cut, often used in ornaments, electronic parts and so on. When cutting copper, the choice of auxiliary gas is important to avoid overheating and material deformation.
                                                      <p></p>
                                                      Titanium and Titanium Alloys (Titanium & Titanium Alloys) : known for their high strength-to-weight ratio and good corrosion resistance, widely used in aerospace, biomedical fields. When laser cutting titanium alloy, due to its good thermal energy absorption, high-speed cutting can be achieved, but attention should be paid to controlling heat to avoid material property changes.
