            <h3>Laser cutting machine cutting stainless steel plate</h3>
            <h4>CO2 laser cutting machine</h4>
            <h5>
              CO2 laser cutters are commonly used for stainless steel cutting because they are able to efficiently cut thicker materials. These lasers produce a high-power infrared beam, which is well absorbed by stainless steel for efficient cutting.</h5>
              <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/0028ced6-1188-45e6-a9e6-9bbb3f7c3f40.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
              <p></p>
              <h4>Prepare materials</h4>
            <h5>
              Accurate measurement and marking of stainless steel plates is essential to achieve accurate cutting. Before laser cutting, the stainless steel surface must be properly cleaned to ensure the best results. Applying a splash-proof coating helps prevent molten metal from adhering to the surface during the cutting process. In order to minimize vibration during the cutting process, it is important to secure the material firmly in place using jigs or fixtures.</h5>
              <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/1F5D49B65C6F101882EC088EE467FEE3.jpg" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
              <p></p>
              <h4>Set up the laser cutter</h4> 
              
            <h5>When setting the stainless steel laser cutting machine, it is necessary to adjust according to the thickness of the plate. For thin parts, such as metal plates or valve plates, the laser power and speed Settings may need to be adjusted to achieve the desired results. On the other hand, thick plates or alloy materials may require higher power levels and slower cutting speeds.</h5>
            <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/fcdf5401-eee7-4b6e-b278-a4092c826b74.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
            <p></p><h4>Cutting process</h4>
            <h5>
              During laser cutting, computer-controlled machines follow programming instructions to accurately create complex shapes and designs. Auxiliary gases such as nitrogen or oxygen are usually used to blow away molten metal and debris from the cut area. The speed at which the laser passes through the material affects the cutting quality and processing time.
            </h5>
            <p></p><h4>Execution cutting</h4>
              <h5>The cutting process begins by entering the design file into the laser cutting machine's software. The machine then uses a laser beam to precisely cut the surface of the stainless steel material according to the design specifications. The laser beam is sharply focused at a focal point, and as the laser beam moves along the cutting path, the stainless steel is melted and evaporated.</h5>
              <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/e31191b1-0700-4f73-b651-d3f85dc89019.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
              <p></p><h4>Monitor and adjust parameters</h4>
            <h5>
              In order to ensure the best cutting results, it is important to monitor and adjust various parameters throughout the process. These parameters include:
              
              Laser power: The power of the laser beam determines its ability to melt or evaporate stainless steel. Adjusting this parameter can precisely control the cutting depth.
              <p></p>
              Cutting speed: The speed at which the laser passes through the material affects the cutting quality and processing time. Finding the right balance is crucial to achieving a clean cut without compromising efficiency.
              <p></p>
              Auxiliary gas pressure: In the laser cutting and engraving process, oxygen or inert gases (such as nitrogen) are often used as auxiliary gases. Controlled cutting gas pressure helps to blow away molten metal and debris, ensuring a cleaner cutting and engraving process.
              <p></p>
              Focus position: Correctly adjusting the focus position of the laser beam ensures accurate engraving and cutting results. Correct adjustment of this parameter can achieve a narrow incision width.
              <p></p>
              Material thickness: Different thicknesses of stainless steel need to adjust the cutting parameters to obtain the best results. Thicker materials may require slower speeds and higher power Settings, while thinner materials may require faster speeds and lower power Settings. By carefully monitoring and adjusting these parameters, laser cutters can make precise cuts to stainless steel with minimal distortion or marks.</h5>
