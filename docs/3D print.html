            <h3>1.3D printer background  </h3>   
            <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/design-make/articles/history-of-3d-printing">Reference</a>
            <h4>1971-1999: The first 3D printer emerges</h4>
            <h5>   Inkjet technology was invented by the Teletype Corporation in the 1960s, a method of “pulling” a drop of material from a nozzle using electronics. It resulted in a device capable of printing up to 120 characters per second and ultimately paved the way for consumer desktop printing.<p></p>

                Teletype later experimented with melted wax as described in a 1971 patent belonging to Johannes F. Gottwald, whose idea was to output an object made of liquified metal that solidified into a shape predetermined by the inkjet’s movement upon each new layer. This device was the Liquid Metal Recorder, which is the basis of rapid prototyping and posited that “printing” could move beyond ink.
                </h5>
            <h4>Material extrusion process</h4>
            <h5>Those were the baby steps into a territory called the material extrusion process, where thermoplastic is fed into a heated nozzle and laid upon an object one “slice” at a time in sequence—the same technique used in consumer desktop 3D printers. It’s speedy and cheap, but the materials (essentially rubbery plastic) aren’t good for much beyond model R2-D2s and racing cars.<p></p>
                In 1980, Dr. Hideo Kodama, a lawyer working for a public research institute in the city of Nagoya, Japan, described two methods for Gottwald’s vision using thermoset polymer—a special plastic that hardens in response to light—instead of metal. His research was published in several papers and resulted in his own November 1981 patent, but a complete lack of interest meant the project went nowhere.<p></p>
                Regardless, the seed was sown. Electronics and defense manufacturer Raytheon filed a patent in 1982 to use powdered metal to add layers to an object. In 1984, entrepreneur Bill Masters filed a patent for a process called Computer Automated Manufacturing Process and System, which mentioned the term 3D printing for the first time. Another 1984 patent in France described additive manufacturing using stereolithography, but like Kodama’s work, it was disregarded as having no commercial appeal.
            
            </h5>
            <h4>3D Systems Corporation’s SLA-1</h4>
            <h5>After all these starts, inventor Chuck Hull was the first person to actually build a 3D printer. Based on his patent for curing photopolymers using radiation, particles, a chemical reaction, or lasers, his design sent the spatial data from a digital file to the extruder of a 3D printer to build up the object one layer at a time.</h5>

           <h5> Hull’s company, 3D Systems Corporation, released the world’s first stereolithographic apparatus (SLA) machine, the SLA-1, in 1987. This machine made it possible to fabricate complex parts, layer by layer, in a fraction of the time it would normally take. Hull went on to file more than 60 patents around the technology, becoming the godfather of the rapid prototyping movement and inventing the STL file format that’s still in use today.</h5>
           <h5>During this era, 3D printing was an emerging technology, and materials science wasn’t what it is today. If the product was made of popular polymers, they tended to warp as it set. At the time, the machines also cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, so 3D printing devices were installed only in heavy manufacturing plants—far out of the reach of consumers.</h5>
<h4>1999–2010: 3D Printing shows its potential</h4>

<h4>2011–present day: 3D Printing in its prime</h4>
<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/4.webp" class="paper-image" alt="pic">

<h5>Today, additive manufacturing is a mature technology. The consumer interest and robustness of industrial platforms grew throughout the 2010s, as the (often hysterical) MakerBot hype settled down and the industry found a groove. Some think additive will replace traditional CNC and milling manufacturing in the future, and a 2021 Lux Research report predicts that 3D printing will be worth $51 billion by 2030.

    The plastic desk toys have been cleared away, leaving the real-world benefits 3D printing offers: everything from printing food to applying multiple materials in the same extrusion process, making the process faster and cheaper.
    
    The range of materials available for 3D printing has also grown exponentially, from bioprinting human tissue and the beginnings of organs tailor-made to patients to crafting products from silver or gold.
    
    The applications are also as varied as inventors’ and engineers’ imaginations. Scientists at the University of Southampton flew the world’s first 3D-printed unmanned aircraft; the makers of a 3D-printed car reached up to 200 mpg with a hybrid gas/electric engine; and a start-up specializing in building ecological living structures came up with a robot-made habitat suitable for living on Mars.
    
    3D printing is being used to build emergency shelter in disaster areas and affordable housing in the developing world. And smart robotics, micromanufacturing, and articulated limb design were combined to to make self-powered prosthetics that give feedback to the brain.
    
    A lot of high-end 3D printing in manufacturing for large structures is done using powder-bed fusion, where various materials can be used in powdered form and fused together using lasers or heat. This is the main process used for metal parts, but it’s expensive and needs very particular infrastructure, making it mainly been feasible for the heavy manufacturing sector.</h5>

    <h3>Postprocess the surface
    <p>
        
            <h4>1.Remove support:
            Prints with support material will require post-processing to remove the support structures. This can be achieved by breaking the support structures from the build material.
            Tear the inner support structure
            Start by removing the walls of the support structure with gripping pliers. This allows you to quickly tear away the majority of the inner support structure. 
            Pull the Breakaway support from the build material
            After removing most of the support structure, the remaining part(s) can be pulled from the build material. Use cutting pliers to grab the Breakaway support in a corner and try to carefully get underneath it, then bend it upwards. Repeat this for several corners, so that you can loosen the support from the model around the corners. After this, pull the Breakaway support from the model.
            Peel the last traces from the model
            Sometimes a final layer of the support material will remain after pulling the Breakaway support from the build material. If this happens, use cutting pliers to peel it off from a loose edge. Any leftover traces on the model can be removed with tweezers.
            <h4> 2.Model coloring: 
            including spray painting and hand painting methods. The spray painting method is suitable for coloring small models or fine parts, and a trial spray is required before operation to test the concentration. The hand coating method is suitable for handling complex details, and attention should be paid to pigment dilution to ensure uniform color.
            <h4>3. Polish model:
             We would use sandpaper to polish model with water ,choice sandpaper 180 for rough polish, 240 for polish and 320 for finish polish  The following is the result 
            3D model .

                A G-code file (usually with a.gcode extension) is an instruction file used to control devices such as CNC machine tools and 3D printers. It is a general-purpose computer numerical control (CNC) programming language that stores a series of instructions in text that instruct a machine how to perform operations, such as moving, cutting, drilling or, in the case of 3D printing, melting and depositing materials.

Specific to 3D printing, G-code files are created from designs in 3D modeling software (common ones such as. STL or.obj format) imported into slicing software (such as Cura, Slic3r, or Simplify3D). The slicing software splits the 3D model into a series of thin layers and generates detailed printing instructions for each layer, including parameters such as the nozzle's moving path, speed, temperature, and extrusion amount. These instructions are organized into lines of G-code commands, with each line representing a specific action or setting.
