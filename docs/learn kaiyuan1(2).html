                    <h5>Source hardware refers to physical artifacts of technology designed and offered in the same manner as free and open-source software. Open source hardware gives people the freedom to control their technology while sharing knowledge and encouraging commerce through the open exchange of designs.</h5>

          <h3>License:</h3>
          <p>
              <h4>The GNU General Public License (GPL)</h4>
              <h5>The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a widely used Free Software license developed and distributed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). It is designed to protect the freedom of software users by ensuring that users can freely run, learn, modify and distribute software, including any modified version based on that software. The core principle of the GPL is "Copyleft," a legal strategy that is the antithesis of the traditional concept of copyright, requiring that when software is distributed in any form, its source code must remain publicly available and be distributed with the same license terms, ensuring that downstream recipients have the same rights as the original recipients.</h5> 
          </p>

        <p>
          <h4>features of the GPL:</h4>
          <h5>a.Free distribution: Allows anyone to obtain a copy of the software, including the source code, for free and can be redistributed without restriction.
            <p></p>
            b.Open source code: Anyone distributing software must provide the source code or provide a way to access the source code.
            <p></p>
            c.License compatibility of derivative works: If GPL-licensed software is modified and distributed, the modified software must also be distributed under the GPL, ensuring that derivative works remain free as well.
            <p></p>
            d.Copyleft contagiousness: This term describes a unique nature of the GPL license, namely that once part of the software is under the GPL, the entire software (if combined or linked) usually must also be released under the GPL. This is in contrast to more lenient licenses such as the LGPL (GNU Less Lenient Public License) or the MIT License, which do not force downstream works to adopt the same license.
            <p></p>
            e.License for Commercial Use: Although the GPL guarantees the free use of software, it does not prohibit the software from being used for commercial purposes. Companies can sell software under the GPL as long as they comply with all conditions of the license.
            <p></p>
            f.Multiple versions: Since its first release in 1989, the GPL has gone through multiple iterations, the latest being Version 3 (GPLv3), which was released in 2007 to address new challenges in the software world, such as software patents and digital rights management (DRM).</h5> 
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h4>well-known free and open source software projects, including the Linux operating system kernel, have adopted the GPL as their license, which has facilitated free software collaboration and innovation worldwide.</h4>
