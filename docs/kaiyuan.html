      <h3>License:</h3>
      <p>
          <h4>The GNU General Public License (GPL)</h4>
          <h5>The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a widely used Free Software license developed and distributed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). It is designed to protect the freedom of software users by ensuring that users can freely run, learn, modify and distribute software, including any modified version based on that software. The core principle of the GPL is "Copyleft," a legal strategy that is the antithesis of the traditional concept of copyright, requiring that when software is distributed in any form, its source code must remain publicly available and be distributed with the same license terms, ensuring that downstream recipients have the same rights as the original recipients.</h5> 
      </p>
    
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cashewwwww/00/img/z0.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
    <p>
      <h4>features of the GPL:</h4>
      <h5>a.Free distribution: Allows anyone to obtain a copy of the software, including the source code, for free and can be redistributed without restriction.
        <p></p>
        b.Open source code: Anyone distributing software must provide the source code or provide a way to access the source code.
        <p></p>
        c.License compatibility of derivative works: If GPL-licensed software is modified and distributed, the modified software must also be distributed under the GPL, ensuring that derivative works remain free as well.
        <p></p>
        d.Copyleft contagiousness: This term describes a unique nature of the GPL license, namely that once part of the software is under the GPL, the entire software (if combined or linked) usually must also be released under the GPL. This is in contrast to more lenient licenses such as the LGPL (GNU Less Lenient Public License) or the MIT License, which do not force downstream works to adopt the same license.
        <p></p>
        e.License for Commercial Use: Although the GPL guarantees the free use of software, it does not prohibit the software from being used for commercial purposes. Companies can sell software under the GPL as long as they comply with all conditions of the license.
        <p></p>
        f.Multiple versions: Since its first release in 1989, the GPL has gone through multiple iterations, the latest being Version 3 (GPLv3), which was released in 2007 to address new challenges in the software world, such as software patents and digital rights management (DRM).</h5> 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>well-known free and open source software projects, including the Linux operating system kernel, have adopted the GPL as their license, which has facilitated free software collaboration and innovation worldwide.</h4>

        <h3>Learn the Arduino IDE,coding method,hardware connect </h3>


        <h4>·Arduino IDE</h4>
        <h5>The Arduino IDE is an open-source integrated development environment for writing and uploading code to Arduino microcontroller boards. It provides an easy-to-use programming environment that allows you to write code for controlling and operating hardware. The Arduino programming language is based on the Processing language and is inspired by the Wiring framework, both of which are programming languages designed for artists and hobbyists.</h5>    
              <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cashewwwww/00/img/OIP.jpg" class="paper-image" alt="pic">


              <h4>·Encoding Method</h4>
<h5>When you open the Arduino IDE, you'll see that there are two basic functions:<p></p>
·setup(): This function is called once each time the power supply is powered to the Arduino board. It is mainly used to initialize variables, set pin patterns, start using library files, etc.</h5>
<h5>·loop(): After setup(), the loop() function is called repeatedly, forming the main loop of the program. Here, you can continuously read sensor data, control motors, update displays, etc.</h5>
<pre><code class="language-html">
void setup() {
    // 初始化代码
  }

void loop() {
    // 持续运行的代码
  }
</code></pre>
<h5>Writing Arduino code typically involves setting up pin modes (input, output, input pull-ups) and then reading or writing to those pins, as well as optionally using serial communication to debug the code.v</h5>
<pre><code class="cpp"></code>
    int ledPin = 13;

    void setup() {
      pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
    }
    
    void loop() {
      digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);   // 打开LED
      delay(1000);                  // 等待一秒钟
      digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);    // 关闭LED
      delay(1000);                  // 等待一秒钟
    }
    </code></pre>

  <h4> ·Hardware connections</h4>
  <h5>The Arduino microcontroller board is connected via multiple pins, which can be digital, analog, PWM, or specifically for communication. Depending on the program you write and the hardware you need to connect, you can connect components such as LEDs, sensors, motors, and more to these pins. Often, you'll also need to consider proper power management and possible electrical isolation.</h5>
  <h5>The steps to connect the hardware typically include:</h5>
 <h6> 1.Physically insert the component into the correct pins of an Arduino board or breadboard (depending on your project and design).
  <p></p>

  <h1>Own case: Motor Control</h1> 
  <p>This experiment utilizes an Arduino board to manipulate a servo motor. The motor will sweep back and forth, pausing for a second at each of the positions - 0, 40, and 80 degrees.</p> 

  <h2>Required Materials:</h2> 
  <p>1. Arduino Development Board </p> 
  <p>2. Servo Motor </p> 
  <p>3. Jumper Wires </p> 

  <h3>Circuit Connection Method:</h3> 

  <p>Before connecting the servo, it is essential to comprehend the control mechanism:</p>
  <p>Servo motors are essentially low-cost servo motor systems and work by receiving PWM pulse modulation signaling through their internal circuitry. This signal controls the movement of the inbuilt motor, which in turn engages a series of reduction gears, transferring torque to the output shaft. A potentiometer connected to the output shaft gives feedback on position, enabling precise motor positioning.</p>
  
  <h3>Construction Process:</h3>

  <p>The SG90 servo has three wires: the power wire (red), ground wire (black or brown), and signal wire (yellow, orange, or white).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Connect the power wire to the 5V pin on the Arduino board.</li>
    <li>Connect the ground wire to the GND pin on the Arduino board.</li>
    <li>Connect the signal pin to digital pin 10 on the Arduino board.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After connections are made, upload the following code to the Arduino board:</p>

        Servo myservo;

        void setup() 
        { 
          myservo.attach(PIN_SERVO); 
        }

        void loop() 
        { 
          myservo.write(0);
          delay(1000); 
          myservo.write(40);
          delay(1000); 
          myservo.write(80);
          delay(1000); 
          myservo.write(40);
          delay(1000); 
          myservo.write(0);
          delay(1000);

<p>Once the code is uploaded to the Arduino board, the servo motor should actuate accordingly, pausing at the specified positions of 0, 40, and 80 degrees for one second each.</p> 
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>This experiment demonstrates precise servo motor control using an Arduino. Simple code instructions enable the manipulation of motor movements between pre-specified positions. This is an insightful experiment for understanding the principles of servo motors and programming them for precision control.</p>








    <h1> Water light effect implementation </h1> 
    <p> This code belongs to an example program that uses Arduino to control 
the NeoPixel LED light strip. Arduino is an easy to use and open source electronic prototyping 
platform, while NeoPixel is a series of LED products produced by Adafruit Industries that have 
built-in WS2811/WS2812 driver chips that individually control the color and brightness of 
each LED. </p> 
    <p><strong> water light effect: </strong> the unlit lights are lit one by one, 
and then gradually extinguished from the beginning end, you can cycle, of course, you can 
also have other effects, you can set yourself. </p> 
    <h2> Materials needed: </h2> 
    <p>1. Arduino UNO </p> 
    <p>2. Jumper </p> 
    <p>3. WS2812B RGB LED ring or NeoPixel LED light strip </p>

                                    <p>   STEP-3 : </p>Design Recommendations - BEFORE STARTING 3D PRINTING
                                    Efficient 3D Design: Use 3D design software like SolidWorks, Fusion 360, Tinkercad, or Blender to create your model.
                                    Print Orientation: Plan the orientation of the part on the 3D printer to minimize the need for supports.
                                    Printing Material: Choose a suitable material for your application.
                                    Wall Thickness and Infill: Adjust the wall thickness and infill of your design according to your needs. 
                                    Easy Assembly: Design parts that are easy to assemble without the need for additional tools.
                                    Consider Tolerances: Take into account tolerances to ensure that the printed parts fit together properly. 
                                    Modular Structure: Divide the structure into smaller modules that can be printed separately and then assembled. 
                                    Iterative Testing: Prototype and test with 3D-printed parts before printing the complete structure. 
                                   Documentation: Document your design in detail. Provide clear assembly instructions, a parts list, and any additional information that might be useful for others looking to build the same robot.
                                    Consider Functionality: Ensure that the structure can accommodate all necessary components.
                                   Strategic Reinforcements: If needed, you can add reinforcements in critical areas of the structure to increase strength and durability.
                                  Optimize for Weight: If mobility is a significant factor, look for ways to optimize the weight of the structure without compromising strength.
                                    Respect Copyrights: If you are using pre-existing designs or third-party components, make sure to respect copyrights and relevant licenses.

                                    <h1>Advantages and disadvantages of open source.
                                      <h3>Advantage:
                                        <h4>  Its main strengths lie in long-term trustworthiness, parallel debugging, parallel development, perfect application programming interfaces, and fast version release. even if the software is no longer developed, one can further utilize the source code.open source software open model can adopt the approach of parallel debugging and parallel research and development, allowing potential unlimited developers on the network to be used for free and simultaneously.The biggest advantage of the open source software development model is that it can receive a large number of support from the open source community, just like having a large number of free software developers and testers.
                                          <h3>Diadvantage:
                                            <h4>  Mainly manifested as management costs, design program issues, and organizational trustworthiness.once the plan develops to a certain extent, the quality of its innovation and correction will inevitably increase.from the perspective of program design issues, the constant release of new versions will cause consumers to constantly reinstall.open source software is contributed by different community members and does not bear the responsibility of quality assurance, compared to traditional software enterprises, it is indeed possible that they may not receive comprehensive support .
