                                    <h3>A plastic material--Polyethylene(PE)</h3>
                                    <h4>Introduction:
                                        <h5>Polyethylene (PE) is a thermoplastic resin produced by polymerization of ethylene monomers. In industry, it also includes copolymers of ethylene and small amounts of alpha olefins.</h5>
                                            <h4>Features:</h4>
                                    <h5>Polyethylene resin is a non-toxic and odorless white powder or particle with a milky white appearance and a waxy texture. It has a low water absorption rate of less than 0.01%. The polyethylene film is transparent and decreases with increasing crystallinity. Polyethylene film has a low water permeability but high air permeability, making it unsuitable for fresh-keeping packaging and suitable for moisture-proof packaging. Flammable, with an oxygen index of 17.4, low smoke during combustion, with a small amount of molten droplets, yellow on top and blue on the flame, and a smell of paraffin. Polyethylene has good water resistance. The surface of the product is non-polar, making it difficult to bond and print, and has been improved through surface treatment. Multiple branched chains result in poor resistance to photodegradation and oxidation.</h5>
                                    <h4>Use :
                                        <h5>Polyethylene is highly sensitive to environmental stress (chemical and mechanical effects) and can be processed using general thermoplastic molding methods. Polyethylene has a wide range of applications, mainly used to manufacture films, packaging materials, containers, pipelines, monofilaments, wires and cables, daily necessities, etc. It can also be used as a high-frequency insulation material for televisions, radars, etc.</h5>

                                    <h3>A composite material--Glass Fibre</h3>
                                    <h4>Introduction:
                                        <h5>Fiberglass is an inorganic non-metallic material with excellent performance. It is made from six types of ores, including pyroxene, quartz sand, limestone, dolomite, boracite, and magnesite, through high-temperature melting, drawing, winding, weaving, and other processes. The diameter of its single filament ranges from a few micrometers to over twenty micrometers, equivalent to 1/20-1/5 of a single hair thread. Each bundle of fiber precursor is composed of hundreds or even thousands of single filaments.
                                            <h4>Features:
                                    <h5>High tensile strength and low elongation; High elasticity coefficient and good rigidity; The elongation within the elastic limit is large and the tensile strength is high, so the absorption of impact energy is large; It is an inorganic fiber with non flammability and excellent chemical resistance; Low water absorption; Excellent scale stability and heat resistance; Good processability, can be used to produce products in different forms such as strands, bundles, felt, and woven fabrics; Transparent and able to transmit light; Good adhesion with resin; Cheap prices; Not easy to burn, can melt into glass like beads at high temperatures.</h5>
                                    <h4>Use:
                                        <h5>1. Enhancing rigidity and hardness, the increase of fiberglass can improve the strength and rigidity of plastics, but the toughness of the same plastic will decrease. Example: Bending modulus; 2. Improve heat resistance and thermal deformation temperature. Taking nylon as an example, by adding fiberglass to nylon, the thermal deformation temperature can be increased by at least twice. Generally, fiberglass reinforced nylon can achieve a temperature resistance of over 220 degrees. 3. Improve dimensional stability and reduce shrinkage rate; 4. Reduce warping deformation; 5. Reduce creep; 6. Due to the candle core effect, the flame retardant performance will interfere with the flame retardant system and affect the flame retardant effect; 7. Reduce surface glossiness; 8. Increase moisture absorption; 9. Fiberglass treatment: The length of fiberglass directly affects the brittleness of the material. If fiberglass is not properly treated, short fibers will reduce impact strength, while long fibers will increase impact strength. To prevent a significant decrease in material brittleness, it is necessary to choose a certain length of fiberglass.</h5>

                                          <h4>Features</h4>
                                          <h5>a.Automatic repair ability: When the material is cracked or damaged due to external force, the self-healing polymer can automatically or under external stimulation to start the repair process without manual intervention.
                                            <p></p>
                                            b.Increased durability: With self-healing capabilities, these materials can significantly improve the overall durability and service life of the product.
                                            <p></p>
                                            c.Wide range of applications: Self-healing polymers are used in many fields, including but not limited to aerospace, automotive manufacturing, building materials, electronic devices, biomedical implants and wearable devices.

                                        <h4>How it works</h4>
                                          <h5>a.Microcapsule technology: Microcapsules containing restorants are embedded in a polymer matrix. When the material is damaged and the microcapsule breaks, a repair agent is released to fill the crack and re-form the chemical bond.
                                            <p></p>
                                            b.Vascular network system: A network of tiny channels is constructed inside the material, similar to the blood vessels of living organisms, through which repair fluid flows. When damage occurs, the repair fluid flows out and solidifies the crack.
                                            <p></p>
                                            c.Dynamic chemical bonding: The use of chemical bonds with dynamic reversible properties (such as hydrogen bonds, metal coordination bonds, etc.) to join polymer chains. These bonds can be broken after damage and re-formed under the right conditions to achieve self-repair.
                                            <p></p>
                                            d.Enzymatic reaction: When specific enzymes are added to the material, when the material is damaged, the enzyme is activated and catalyzes the repair reaction, promoting crack closure.
                                        </p>
                        
                                        <h4>The latest developments</h4>
                                          <h5>Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT Bhilai) have developed a self-healing polymer coating material for photovoltaic applications that can self-heal cracks in minutes, providing a more durable protection solution for products such as solar panels.

It can protect the wood from ultraviolet light, moisture, corrosion and other factors, and prolong the service life of the wood. Painting treatment can choose different colors and gloss, make the wood surface look more beautiful. Before painting, wood surfaces are polished to remove sawdust, stains and uneven surfaces. Then, choose the appropriate paint for brushing, brushing should pay attention to uniform brushing, to avoid leakage brush or too thick. Regular maintenance is also required to maintain the luster and protective effect of the paint surface.</h5>
