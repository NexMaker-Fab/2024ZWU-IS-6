Flammable, with an oxygen index of 17.4, low smoke during combustion, with a small amount of molten droplets, yellow on top and blue on the flame, and a smell of paraffin. Polyethylene has good water resistance. The surface of the product is non-polar, making it difficult to bond and print, and has been improved through surface treatment. Multiple branched chains result in poor resistance to photodegradation and oxidation.</h5>

                <h4>Self-healing Polymer(SHP)</h4>
                
                <h5>Self-healing polymers are a class of advanced materials that have the ability to self-repair cracks or damaged areas after damage, thereby extending the life of the material and improving its reliability and safety. This property mimics the self-healing mechanisms of certain organisms in nature and is an important innovation in materials science.</h5> 
            </p>

            <p>
              <h4>Features</h4>
              <h5>a.Automatic repair ability: When the material is cracked or damaged due to external force, the self-healing polymer can automatically or under external stimulation to start the repair process without manual intervention.
                <p></p>
                b.Increased durability: With self-healing capabilities, these materials can significantly improve the overall durability and service life of the product.
                <p></p>
                c.Wide range of applications: Self-healing polymers are used in many fields, including but not limited to aerospace, automotive manufacturing, building materials, electronic devices, biomedical implants and wearable devices.
                <p></p>
                d.Design diversity: Self-healing mechanisms are diverse and can be realized based on dynamic covalent bond, non-covalent bond interaction, microencapsulation technology or enzymatic catalyzed reactions.
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <h4>How it works</h4>
              <h5>a.Microcapsule technology: Microcapsules containing restorants are embedded in a polymer matrix. When the material is damaged and the microcapsule breaks, a repair agent is released to fill the crack and re-form the chemical bond.
                <p></p>
                b.Vascular network system: A network of tiny channels is constructed inside the material, similar to the blood vessels of living organisms, through which repair fluid flows. When damage occurs, the repair fluid flows out and solidifies the crack.
                <p></p>
                c.Dynamic chemical bonding: The use of chemical bonds with dynamic reversible properties (such as hydrogen bonds, metal coordination bonds, etc.) to join polymer chains. These bonds can be broken after damage and re-formed under the right conditions to achieve self-repair.
                <p></p>
                d.Enzymatic reaction: When specific enzymes are added to the material, when the material is damaged, the enzyme is activated and catalyzes the repair reaction, promoting crack closure.

                b.High energy efficiency: The conversion efficiency of quantum dot materials to light is extremely high, which means that at the same brightness, quantum dot display devices can be more energy-efficient than traditional display devices.
                <p></p>
                c.Strong stability: Compared with some organic luminescent materials, quantum dots, as inorganic materials, have better light stability and thermal stability, which can ensure that the color is still bright after long-term use, extending the life of the display product.
                <p></p>
                d.Thinness and flexibility: While current quantum-dot TVS are mainly based on LCD technology (QD-LCD), research is also advancing quantum-dot light-emitting diode (QLED) technology, which promises thinner panels and the possibility of flexible displays.

            <h4>The latest developments</h4>
              <h5>Although quantum dot display technology has gained a certain share in the market, researchers and companies continue to optimize the preparation process of quantum dots, explore more environmentally friendly quantum dot materials (reduce or avoid the use of harmful elements such as cadmium), and develop direct light emitting quantum dot display technology (QLED). The goal is to achieve lower power consumption, higher brightness and wider color gamut display effect, and further promote the innovation of display technology.

                <h4> Chemical cross-linking: Silane cross-linking and cross-linking agent</h4>
                This technology uses vinyl silane containing double bonds to react with molten polymers under the action of an initiator to form a silane-grafted polymer, which is hydrolysed in contact with water in the presence of a silanol condensation catalyst to form a reticulated oxyalkane-chained cross-linking structure. Silane cross-linking technology due to its cross-linking equipment used is simple, the process is easy to control, less investment, high degree of cross-linking of the finished product, good quality, thus greatly promoting the production and application of cross-linked polyethylene. In addition to polyethylene, silane, crosslinking also need to use catalysts, initiators, antioxidants and so on.

Paint treatment can be chosen in different colours and sheens to make the wood surface look more beautiful. Painting is divided into the following steps:<p></p> 1. cleaning the wood surface <p></p>
                  2. trimming and sanding <p></p>3. filling holes and cracks<p></p> 4. applying paint<p></p> 5. coating: after the first coat dries, a second coat is applied to increase coverage and durability. <p></p>6. drying <p></p>7. sanding and polishing<p></p> 8. protective coatings</h5>
