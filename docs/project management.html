    <h3>STEP 1 : Installing necessary Tools</h3>
        We installed all the following tools to build the website
        - Git; It serves as a control system for tracking changes to the code base, collaborating, managing project versions, which allows us to clone, commit, and push changes to GitHub.

            <p></p>
            - Github desktop;Since it is a user-friendly GUI application, we use it to streamline our Git workflow, allowing us to easily clone, commit, and sync repositories.

            <p></p>
            - Nodejs;  Since the tool includes NPM, we used it to manage packages, interact with the command line, and integrate with VScode

            <p></p>

            <p></p>

<h3>STEP 2 : Open repository into GitHub</h3>
NB: Before we begin, it is worth noting that the GitHub repository had already been setup for our team website by our supervisor. It enables us to upload our website pages to a server for us to edit as team and also setup for others to open and view the work we have done during the course of the module.
<h4>Repository Setup for Nexmaker:</h4>
<h5>Set up the page
<h6>We visited the GitHub website (https://github.com) and registered a new account, login.
<p></p>
<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%877.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
<p></p>
Firstly, register and establish a public repository on github.com for others to modify. Also, include a README file to describe the website.
    There are two ways to open the new repository page:</5>
    <p>Method 1:</p>
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%878.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
    <p>Method 2:</p>
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%879.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8710.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
    <p></p>
    Then we gave it a name (Team-Gladiators) being in the admin's account and selected whether it should be public or private. Then, after enabling the readme, click create repository.
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8711.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">

    <p></p>
    Go to repository settings, choose 'Pages' in the sidebar. Under GitHub pages, select main and '/root', then save. This will be switched to '/docs' after installing Docsify, as it's not yet set up.
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8712.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">

    <h4>How to collaborate with team</h4>
    <h5>(As we outline the methods of team collaboration post-website development, the images used are from our team repository. Don't let the repository name confuse you. When collaborating with your team, remember to use your team's repository and follow these steps)</h5>
<p></p>
    <h5>Emphasizing on team collaboration is vital for this course due to the substantial workload, which could otherwise be tiring. If the team works cohesively, the course will be manageable, enjoyable, and won't interfere with your leisure time.
<p></p>
<h5>Team Operations</h5>
<h5>
    Given that students come from various fields, engaging with a diverse group on GitHub can be a stimulating experience. This diversity can enrich the team's collective skills, provide a range of perspectives, and amplify the productivity and inclusiveness of the environment. Here's a comprehensive guide on using GitHub for collaboration when team members originate from diverse sectors:</h5>
    <h4>STEP 1 : Open the repository.</h4>
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8713.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
    <h4>STEP 2 : Go to setting > Collaborators and teams > and click Add people from the manage access section</h4>
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8714.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
    <h4>STEP 3 : Search for member by their name or email address</h4>
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8715.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
    <h4>STEP 4 : Select the member and choose the role and Add</h4>
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8716.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8717.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
    <h5>Now the member name is in the Collaborators and teams list.
        Roles could be change by the team requirements : Here the newly added member set a maintain role and another member as a write role.</h5>
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8718.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
<p></p>
<h5>Like this way there 5 kinds of roles in github to maintain project :
    Read - This role allows the user to read and clone the repository. They can also initiate discussions and comments on issues and pull requests.
    Triage - The triage role encompasses the permissions of the Read role, along with the ability to manage issues and pull requests.
    Write - In addition to the privileges of the Triage role, users with Write access can also push changes to the repository.
    Maintain - Users with this level of permission can read, clone, and push changes to the repository. They can manage issues, pull requests, and certain settings of the repository.
    Admin - Admin users enjoy complete access, which includes all of the features of the Maintain role plus the power to manage the repository's settings and add collaborators.</h5>


    <h3>STEP 3 :Publish the page from GitHub</h3>
    <h5>Create a repository, or have an existing repository, click the setting > pages option.
    <p></p>
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E7%89%871.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
    <p></p>
    <h5>Create an entry file for the site. GitHub Pages will find index.html, index.md or README.md files as entry files to the site. In the Github Pages page, you can choose which folder of which branch of the repository to publish to the Github page as the root directory of the website: finally click the Save button.
    <p></p>
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E7%89%872.png" class="paper-image" alt="pic">
    <p></p>
<h6>If the publishing source is a branch and a folder, the entry file must be located at the top of the source folder on the source branch. For example, if the release source is the /docs folder on the main branch, the entry file must be located in the /docs folder on the branch named main.
    If the release source is the GitHub Actions workflow, the deployed project must contain the entry file at the top of the project. You can choose to use GitHub Actions workflow to generate entry files when the workflow is running, instead of adding entry files to the repository.</h6>
<p></p>
<h5>Then wait quietly for about 5 minutes, then refresh the page, and you can see a prompt to visit the website: then click Visit sate to visit your website:</h5>

<h3>STEP 4 :Clone the repository into GitHub</h3>
    <h5>To clone repoc, please open GitHub Desktop. Find the "Clone Repository" option, search for the repository created on the GitHub website, and then click "Clone".</h5>

<p></p>

<h3>Step-7 Code writing</h3>
<h5>-Add navigation bar and side bar/Document writing
    We have provided guidance for the sidebar and navigation bar through code.
   This is index.xml, with attached image code, This includes adding images, hyperlinks, and CSS animations.:</h5>
   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/y20522/image-cloud/img/%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%811.png" class="paper-image"alt="pic">

   <h5>-Add image
    We follow the website(https://www.nexmaker.com/doc/1projectmanage/imageuploadservice.html) posted by the teacher step by step
    <p></p>
    <h5>The function of Image upload service is to storage your picture or video on cloud and then you can use the link in your markdown document.Then Image upload service will export one link for your information(it would used in markdown document).The following show one method using PicGo and gitlab to build.</h5>
<p></p>
<h6>1.Download PicGo application from github and install it.
    2.Open PicGo and setting the software.Now we need open gitlab to get some information(obvious we have some other choice to storage our information ,for example Github ,Aliyun OSS ,Imgur,etc),
    3.url: gitlab url (eg:https://gitlab.com)
    4.group: gitlab project's group name
    5.project: gitlab project name
    6.token: gitlab's api token (Setting /Access Token/Click )
    7.OK ,update picture to gitlab
    8.method1: right click and choice update picture with picgo
    9.method2:push picture to picgo</h6>
